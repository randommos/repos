    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Turn your weeknight dinner into a fancy affair with 
        this easy pork tenderloin recipe.</p>



    <h2>ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh sage, leaves removed and stems discarded, divided</li>
        <li>6 ounces prosciutto</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Lightly season pork with salt and black pepper. 
            Arrange about 6 sage leaves over tenderloin. Wrap 
            prosciutto around tenderloin and sage, overlapping
             prosciutto slightly; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate
              to allow prosciutto to set on pork tenderloin,
               5 to 10 minutes. Remove plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
            Fry wrapped tenderloin in the hot oil until 
            prosciutto is crispy and lightly browned on all 
            sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer wrapped tenderloin
             to a baking dish, reserving oil in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Bake tenderloin in the preheated oven until pork 
            is cooked through, about 20 minutes. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at
             least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium heat; 
            fry remaining sage leaves until crispy, adding more 
            oil as needed, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium heat; fry 
            remaining sage leaves until crispy, adding more oil as 
            needed, about 5 minutes.
        </li>

    </ol>
